# 🗄️ SQL Projects — Data Analysis with MySQL

This repository showcases my **SQL development and data analysis work** completed using **MySQL Workbench** as part of a Data Technician Bootcamp. The projects demonstrate a progression from **database fundamentals** to **real-world business querying**, using well-known sample databases such as **Northwind** and **World**.

---

## 📘 Database Fundamentals

### Concepts Covered
- Primary and foreign keys
- One-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships
- Relational vs non-relational databases
- Data modelling and table relationships

**Examples include:**
- Customer–Order relationships
- Product–Category–Supplier models
- Real-world database design patterns

## 🧾 Project 1: Northwind Traders — Business Querying

### Overview
Using the **Northwind database**, this project simulates real-world business requests from marketing, logistics, product, and sales teams. Each task required translating a business question into a precise SQL query.

### Key Query Types
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- Filtering with `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `DISTINCT`
- Sorting and conditional logic
- Aggregations using `COUNT()` and `SUM()`

### Example Business Questions
- Retrieve customer data for marketing campaigns
- Identify high-value products and mid-range inventory
- Analyse customer locations for logistics planning
- Review recent orders and historical sales

## 🔗 Project 2: SQL JOINs & Relational Analysis

### Overview
This project focuses on **joining multiple tables** to produce meaningful, multi-dimensional reports from relational data.

### JOIN Types Used
- `INNER JOIN`
- `LEFT JOIN`
- `RIGHT JOIN`
- `FULL JOIN`
- `SELF JOIN`
- `CROSS JOIN`

### Business Scenarios
- Linking products to suppliers
- Classifying products by category
- Producing complete order overviews (customers + employees)
- Building supply chain reports combining products, categories, and suppliers

### Analytical Techniques
- Table aliasing for readability
- Grouping and aggregation
- Sorting and filtering joined datasets

## 🌍 Project 3: World Database — Global Insights

### Overview
Using the **World database**, this project applies SQL to global demographic and economic analysis, supporting realistic research and policy-style questions.

### Analysis Topics
- City and country population analysis
- Life expectancy comparison
- Capital city identification
- Population density calculations
- GDP per capita exploration
- Pattern matching with `LIKE`
- Pagination using `LIMIT` and offsets

### Example Insights
- Most and least populated cities
- Countries with largest populations
- Cities exceeding specific population thresholds
- Countries with low population density
- Capital city population comparisons
